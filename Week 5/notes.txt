whenever we send a request to any website a http request goes out. and the server returns json or html data

HEADERS IN HTTP

along with the request there is some other information sent in form of the headers 

the headers are key value pairs between a client and a server
they mostly contain metadata, authentication data , content type , referer

there are both request and response headers which send different types of requests
the request headers contain the user related info and the request related info
the response header contains the metadata about the response

index.html -> to test: http://localhost:3000/sum?a=2&b=5
index.html -> to test: http://localhost:3000/mul?a=2&b=5
index.html -> to test: http://localhost:3000/div?a=2&b=5

the input in the http request can be sent by the query parameters 

FETCH API 

there are two ways to send http requests
1. direct request
2. background requests -> fetch api

fetch("https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts/1");
fetch sends the request to other server get the data

AXIOS LIBRARY

index2.html

axios is an external library for calling libraries

index.js -> creating a http server

the fetch and axios run on AJAX -> Asynchronous JSON and XML 
EJS -> (Embeded JavaScript) is used for tampleting

MIDDLEWARES

middlewares are the functions that have access to the request object, response object and the next() function. It is a layer on top of the request-response cycle

1. modifying the request or response objects
2. ending the request-response cycle
3. calling the next middlewares function in the stack

the middleware may or may notchane the request object 
the middleware will either stop the request or forward the request to the real route handler

commonly used middlewares 

1. express.json() -> used to parse incoming request bodies that are formatted as JSON

2. cors -> cross origin resource sharing

in express by default cross origin requests are blocked

this lets the frontends communicate with the backend securely

to host or share files on intranet 

npx serve -> this will serve in the files on the private ip
this helps serve static files
