axios knows by itself that the data sent will be json
axios is a promise based http client

for fetch we need to know what is the type of data is retrurned by the server

01.js -> to check the incoming requests httpdump.app

we cannot send body in get request, we can send the extra deta in query params 

in a post request second argument will be body , third argument is the header

the fetch returns the json object, the body mainlt contains the data

we can write the fetch in both frontend and backend, generally in the frontend (client side)
