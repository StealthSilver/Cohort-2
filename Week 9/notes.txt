FOUNDATIONS OF REACT

for static websites react is not needed
before react and vue, jQuery and backbone.js were used to make DOM manipulation easier

DYNAMIC WEBSITE CONCEPTS

STATE : this is the js object that represents the state of the app. in represents the dynamic things in the app (things that change)

the components are re-usable and dynamic

* A state change triggers a re-render. A re-render represents the actual DOM being manipulated when the state changes

* we usually have to define all teh components once and then we have to update the state of the app
