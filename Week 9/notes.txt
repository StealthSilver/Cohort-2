FOUNDATIONS OF REACT

for static websites react is not needed
before react and vue, jQuery and backbone.js were used to make DOM manipulation easier

every react website finally renders into HTML, CSS and JS

DYNAMIC WEBSITE CONCEPTS

basic dynamic website -> index.html 

STATE : this is the js object that represents the state of the app. in represents the dynamic things in the app (things that change)

State management tools
1. Redux
2. Recoil
3. Zustand


COMPONENTS : it represents how the DOM element should render, given a state. 
the components are re-usable and dynamic

Component Libraries 
1. Material UI
2. Ant Design
3. Chakra UI
4. React Bootstrap 
5. ShadCN

* A state change triggers a re-render. A re-render represents the actual DOM being manipulated when the state changes

* we usually have to define all teh components once and then we have to update the state of the app

React V-0 code -> index2.html

React files are written in JSX -> JavaScript XLM as it returns the components in XML
