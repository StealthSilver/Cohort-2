TYPESCRIPT 

there are two kinds of languages Strongly and Loosly typed

Strongly Typed : Go, Typescript , C++ , Rust , Java
Loosly Typed : Python , Javascript , Pearl

Typescript compiles down to js 
tsc is the typescript compiler
there are other compilers esbuild, svc etc.

tsconfig.json contains the meta information for typescript compilation

typescript is a superset of JS

to compile npx tsc -b 
then node [file name of the javascript file] 

basic types in ts are 
number , string , boolean , null , undefined 

there is a any type -> this can be anything there won't be any error

tsconfig.json 


target:
The target option in a tsconfig.json file specifies the ECMAScript target version to which the TypeScript compiler will compile the TypeScript code.
To try it out, try compiling the following code for target being ES5 and es2020
"target" : "ES5"

2. rootDir
Where should the compiler look for .ts files. Good practise is for this to be the src folder
3. outDir
Where should the compiler look for spit out the .js files.

"rootDir": "./src",
"outDir": "./dist",

this will create a dist folder which will contain all the js files
