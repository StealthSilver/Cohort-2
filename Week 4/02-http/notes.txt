HTTP Servers

http servers are created in different languages with frameworks

JavaScript -> Express , NestJS 
Java -> Spring Boot
Rust -> actix-web
Python -> Django
Ruby -> Rails

whenever you are visiting any website you are communication via http requests
these requests can be checked on the network tab in inspect mode

the http protocol runs on the request response model

creating the protocol -> https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2616 

there are other protocols to communicate
1. WebSockets
2. WebRTC 
3. GRPC

DOMAIN NAME / IP

the names associated with the server ip address are called the domain names 
the check the ip address of any server use the ping command

ping google.com -> to get the ip address 
use sudo vi /etc/hosts -> to check which ip is pointing to which domain name

to get a live website
1. buy a server instance from AES -> get the ip address 
2. buy a domain name from say godddy 
3. point the domain name to the IP address

PORTS 

they are logical endpoints in networking used by protocols to identify specific processes running on a computer or a server

most modern websites run on port 443 on the web
locally we can run websites on different ports 

default ports: 
HTTP -> 80
HTTPS -> 443
SSH -> 22

METHODS 

they are action keywords which denote the CRUD operations

C -> CREATE -> POST
R -> READ -> GET
U -> UPDATE -> PUT
D -> DELETE -> DELETE

to check and send requests -> download postman

RESPONSES

the server can return teh responses in various formats 

JSON -> JavaScript Object Notation
PLAIN TEXT 
HTML

STATUS CODES 

they are a 3 digit number returnes by a server to indicate a outcome of a client request 

200 series : success 
300 series : redirect
400 series : client error -> client is sending some erronous data
500 series : server error -> server crashed


BODY :

it refers to the part of an HTTP message that contains the actual data being sent to the server
usually the data is transferred in the JSON format

ROUTES :

routes are the paths or endpoints that defne how te incoming requests will be handles by the servers


HTTPS -> HYPER TEXT TRANSFER PROTOCOL SECURED

index.js -> creating a http server 

use the express library

ping localhost -> returns the ip of your own machine
