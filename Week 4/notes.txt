npm
pacakage maangers allows us to use the external packages , libraries or packages 
packages contain the reusable code

npm install chalk -> using the "chalk" library

Using the external library

index.js
import chalk from "chalk"; -> importing the library

node_modules is a very heavy folder
we need not commit it on github, every dependency in the node_modeules is there in pckage.json 
to get the node_modules locally we just have to run npm install
