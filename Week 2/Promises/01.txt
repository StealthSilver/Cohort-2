Classes in JS

primitive types
1. number
2. string
3. boolean

complex types

JS does not have a concept of destructor -> it does the memeory management by itself

classes will have the properties and methods

JS has ita own classes 
e.g. Date class -> for the time related stuff , Map class

03.js , 04.js , 05.js

Promise class 
promise class gives a promise, that it will return something in future

callback based approach and promise based approach both can be used but the later one is better
