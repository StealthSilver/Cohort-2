SYNCHRONOUS FUNCTIONS  (01.js)

A synchronous (sync) function is one that runs one after the other.
It means that the program will wait for the current task to finish
before moving on to the next task.
(the code euns in order)

ASYNCHRONOUS FUNCTIONS 

An asynchronous (async) function is one that allows other tasks to run while
itâ€™s waiting for something to finish (like loading data or waiting for a
response from a server). This means the program doesn't need to wait for
the async task to finish before continuing to the next one.
(the code runs out of order)
