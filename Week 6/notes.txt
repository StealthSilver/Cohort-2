AUTHENTICATION 

following are the steps how authentication works on any website

1. the user comes to your website
2. the user sends a request to /signin with their username and password 
3. the user gets back a token
4. in every subsequesnt request, the user sends the token to identify it self to the backend

JWT -> JSON WEB TOKENS

the JWT are compact ans self contained way to represent information between two parties
JWT's contain all teh information needed to authenticate a request, so the server dosen't need to store session data.
All the data is stored in the token itself 

JWT prevent 1 round trip from the backend server and database for any user request
