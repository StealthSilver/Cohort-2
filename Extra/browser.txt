Components of a browser: 

1. Data : Cookies , Local Storage
2. UI : the interface of browser 
3. Browser Engine :
4. Rendering Engine : 
5. JS Engine : Dino, V8
6. Network
7. Timers: Node JS dosen't have any timers it uses browser timers 


1. Rendering of HTMl 

> the HTML file is loaded on the browser
> the raw bytes are read 
> the encoding method is checked (UTF 8) and bytes are converted into characters
> the characters are tokenized 
> the attributes of the HTML tags are converted in objects
> the heiarchy of the tags are structured which creats the DOM (Document Object Model)
> all the elements are modified as a tree the tags present in form of the Node List 

2. Rendering of CSS 

> the CSS is also converted into raw bytes and loaded 
> the raw bytes are converted into characteres and then tokens
> the tokens thus form the objects and establish relations with the HTML DOM
> then the CSSOM (CSS Object Model) is created

* the HTML DOM and CSSOM are created parallely and independently 

> the render tree starts forming using the DOM and the CSSOM, this process is performed by the browser engine 
> the browser engine does the calculations for the size and color provided by the CSSOM 
> whenever the browser engine encounters the script tag then the browsers stops rendering and run all the scripts 
> then the JS execution halts until the CSSOM is ready and after then the script is completely executed
> the differing of script is done using the async functions which starts the browser clocks and keep track of the time
