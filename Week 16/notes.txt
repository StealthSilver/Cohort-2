WEBSOCKETS 

web sockets is another protocol like HTTP 

WebSockets provide a way to establish a persistent,
full-duplex communication channel over a single TCP connection between the client (typically a web browser) and the server.

persistent means that once a connection is made it stays there for a connection there is a three way handshake
1. browser asks the server to connect
2. server allows the browser to connect 
3. the browser establishes a connection

the same connection is established by the WEB-rtc protocol
