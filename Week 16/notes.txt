WEBSOCKETS 

web sockets is another protocol like HTTP 

WebSockets provide a way to establish a persistent,
full-duplex communication channel over a single TCP connection between the client (typically a web browser) and the server.

for any connction there is a three way handshake
1. browser asks the server to connect
2. server allows the browser to connect 
3. the browser establishes a connection

web sockets create a persistent connection persistent means that once a connection is made it stays there for a connection
the same connection is established by the WEB-rtc protocol

in HTTP we can use polling or non-polling to create the same architecture

Soket-IO is used by Coin DCX and Canva

web sockets are used in
for real time communication -> used in trading applications in their order book (ws.backpack.exchange)
for chat applications
for sports update applications
for financial tickers
for interactive services -> excelidraw

in leetcode polling is used -> they can use websockets but they use polling

there are various libraries in node js which use websockets

1.https://www.npmjs.com/package/websocket
2.https://github.com/websockets/ws
3.https://socket.io/

we will use the ws library

socket io is another protocol dependent on websockets, it makes using the websockets cleaner
using socket io in cross platform is tough but there are libraries

metaverse -> used websockets for chat and web rtc(UDP) for motion or voice chat
