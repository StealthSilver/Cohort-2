  UI vs. UX  

-   UI (User Interface)  : The visual elements the user interacts with.
-   UX (User Experience)  : How the user feels while interacting with the interface.

  Key Principles of User Interface  :
1.   Hierarchy  : Establish a clear order for the content.
2.   Consistency  : Ensure similar visuals have similar functionality.
3.   Whitespace  : Use empty space to make important elements stand out.
4.   Continuity  : Maintain a logical flow in content placement.

  Key Principles of User Experience  :
1.   Hick's Law  : Avoid overwhelming users with too many options on a single page.
2.   Fitt's Law  : The time to reach a target is influenced by its size and distance.
3.   Jakob's Law  : Users prefer interfaces that feel familiar.
4.   Miller's Law  : People can hold at most 7 items in their short-term memory.
5.   Law of Proximity  : Objects close to each other are perceived as related.
6.   Aesthetic-Usability Effect  : Users perceive visually appealing designs as more usable.
