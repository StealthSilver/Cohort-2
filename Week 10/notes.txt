Single Page Applications 
SPA are web Applications that load a single HTMl page and dynamically update that page as the user interacts with the app

01-react routing

npm i react-router-dom

there are same libraries for routing in mobiler and desktop apps made with react native
use the Link tab to navigate instead of a tag or we can use the useNavigate hook

the useNavigate hook is used for the partial routing

Layouts -> they are used to stick some components of the page that do not change

02-react -> useRef

useRef is a hook in react that provides a way to create a refrence to a value or a DOM element that persists across renders 
but does not trigger a re-render when the value changes

uses are focusing on an value or a DOM element
refrence to a value is gien such that when we change the value the component does not re-render

there are three ways to define variables in react :
1. raw variables : let value = 1
2. use state : [value , setValue] = useState(0)
3. refrences : valueRef = useRef();

03-react -> clock with a start and a stop button
