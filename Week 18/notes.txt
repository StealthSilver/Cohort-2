ORMs 

Object-Relational Mapping 
this is a pogramming technique to convert incompatible data typw systems in object oriented programming languages
this creates a virtual object database ÃŸ

mongoose is sort of a orm -> it is a ODM (object document mapping)

PRISMA, this is an ORM 
this is helps in migration from one db to another.

* migrating the raw data is really tought but chnaging the server side code is easy

Prisma gives us automatic migrations if using pg we will need to create mgrations by our own.

PRISMA can be used with mongo, mysql, postgres

creating a prisma app 

initialize the ts server 

then npx prisma init 

this will generate a schema.prisma and the .env file
write the db url in the .env file 

create the models and write the schema
then migrate the db, command : npx prisma migrate dev

now we have to change the schema in schema.prisma and then re-migrate, it will automatically genereate the migrations and tables

to dry run a migration in prisma 

whenever the schema is changed then remigrate the db

if there is already some data in the then if a new field is added then either make the field optional or give it  default value which will be applied to all the entries from before

generating the prisma client : npx prisma generate
client represents all the functions that convert the orm provided functions into SQL code

** remove the output   = "../src/generated/prisma" from the prisma.schema 
it will else give errors

relationships: 
there are a diffrent types of realtionships, one-many , one-one, many-one, many-many
