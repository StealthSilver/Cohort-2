NEXT JS 

1. In a React project, you have to maintain a separate Backend project for your API routes
2. React does not provide out of the box routing (you have to use react-router-dom)
3. React is not SEO Optimised (not exactly true today because of React Server components)
4. Waterfalling problem

the react is not SEO optimised because of the waterfalling problem 

SEO OPTIMIZATION 

Google/Bing has a bunch of crawlers that hit websites and figure out what the website does. 
It ranks it on Google based on the HTML it gets back
The crawlers DONT usually run your JS and render your page to see the final output. 

Waterfall problem 

1. Fetching the index.html from the CDN
2. Fetching script.js from CDN
3. Checking if user is logged in (if not, redirect them to /login page)
4. Fetching the actual blogs
5. There are 4 round trips that happen one after the other (sequentially)
