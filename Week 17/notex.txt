TYPES OF DBs 

* to check if a website is using mongo or not, if there is a _id: field in the api calls.

1. NoSQL dbs : (No structured query language db) they are schmealess : a nested structure can be easily created with nosql dbs like mongo and firebase 
we can change the schema whenever we want. mongoose library enforces schemas at the nodejs level, mongo directly is schemaless
gatehertown is also using firebase, but scaling firebase and other nosql dbs are hard.
migrating from mongo to a sql db is hard so applciations generally use the sql dbs 

it is a good thing to have schemas, having strict fields is good as they can catch errors

2. Graph DB : data is stored in form of graphs, useful in relationship models, e.g. Neo4j

3. Vector dbs: store data in form of vectors, embedding is done, useful in machine learning
e.g. pinecone

4. SQL dbs : Postgres, MySQL (structure query language db)
promQs is another Query language used for prometheus

stores data in form of rows, most full stack applciations use this 

the schemaless property of the noSql dbs make its vulnurable to data getting corrupted, runtime erros, inconsistent database

SQl dbs have a strict schema, 
to insert data in the db
1. define the schemas 
2. put the data that follows that schema 
3. update the schema as the app changes and perform migrations (DB mighration)

there are 4 parts when using a SQL db:
1. running the db
2. using a library that lets you connect to the db 
3. creating a table and defining it's schema 
4. run queries on the db to interact with the data

to start the db go to neon.tech
create a new project

psql 'postgresql://neondb_owner:***********f@ep-silent-wave-afzqxl71-pooler.c-2.us-west-2.aws.neon.tech/neondb?sslmode=require&channel_binding=require'

there are postgresql guis that let you connect to the db 
1. psql 
to run it: install it and then write the command 

psql -h hostname -d database name -U username 
than write the password, you will get connected to the sql db

then write the commands, either locally or in the Sql editor in neon db

this is the connection string
postgresql://username:password@host/database

CRUD OPERATIONS 

INSERT
SELECT 
UPDATE 
DELETE 

creating a nodejs backend with sql db

using PostgeSQL client, library -> pg 

Relationships and Transactions 

no-sql databases do not prevent a nested structure for the db. it is good for a course selling application

relationships let store data in different table and let us connect the tables
no-sql databases do not support foreign keys

transactions are combined queries, so that either bith teh queries succeed or both fails
