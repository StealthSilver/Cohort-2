Custom hooks 

useState -> store a state variable, re-render a component when the variable changes 
useEffect -> Run an effect whenever a dependency changes  

custom hook is a function but it should start with use, it should use another hook inside it
you should never write a native function using a hook

useCounter hook - 01-react :

we use custom hooks for increase readability and resuing

reusing the useCounter hook - 02-react 

usePostTitle hook - 03-react
the fetch call to get the data from the backend is written in the use effect hook

we can shift the hook logic in a seperate file, in src create hooks folder and the file name can be hookName.js or hookName.jsx

useFetch : takes the url for the backend and returns the data from the backend
