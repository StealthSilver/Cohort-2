DOM : Document Object Model 

The DOM is a programming for web documents.
the DOM represents the structure of a web page as a tree of objects
the DOM allows the scripts to manipulate the content and structure dynamically


Static Website - index.html

to create a dynamic website we need to create these four functionalities
1. READ
2. CREATE 
3. EDIT 
4. DELETE

Basic functions on the document object 

1. querySelector
2. querySelectorAll
3. getElementById
4. getElementByClassName
5. removeChild
6. createElement
7. appendChild
8. setAttribute

Dynamic Website - index2.html 
Final Website - index3.html

COMPLEX DOM MANIPUALTION

for making the manipulation easier state and component were introduced

State -> the variable parts of the app (vidoes , profile pic , description in linked in)
Component -> the structure (backbone) of the app (navbar , search bar in linked in)
Rendering -> taking the state and putting it on the components in the DOM

using the render function and updating the state variables -> index4.html

react does reconcilation in which it updates the state and rerenders the components
