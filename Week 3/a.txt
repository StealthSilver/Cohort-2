DOM : Document Object Model 

the DOM represents the structure of a web page as a tree of objects
the DOM allows the scripts to manipulate the content and structure dynamically


Static Website - index.html

Basic functions on the document object 

1. querySelector
2. querySelectorAll
3. getElementById
4. getElementByClassName
5. removeChild
6. createElement
7. appendChild
8. setAttribute

Dynamic Website - index2.html 
Final Website - index3.html

COMPLEX DOM MANIPUALTION

for making the manipulation easier state and component were introduced

State -> the variable parts of the app (vidoes , profile pic , description in linked in)
Component -> the structure (backbone) of the app (navbar , search bar in linked in)
Rendering -> taking hte state and putting it on the components in the DOM

using the render function and updating the state variables -> index4.html

react does reconcilation in which it updates the state and rerenders the components
