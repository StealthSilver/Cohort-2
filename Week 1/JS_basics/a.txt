JS - JavaScript

JS is primarily a web dev library but we can do other stuff like  mediasoup library -> web RTC

React and NextJS are frameworks, they compile down to HTML, CSS and JS. Browser only understands this it just understands JS
the code written in C++ or other languages in the coding platforms runs in the local servers and then it is converted back to JS and rendered by the Browser

C++ and Rust and other languages can be compiled on the browser through Web Assembly


Properties of JS

1. Interpreted 
It runs line by line and it is compiled at run time

rust compiles very slow, it is really memory safe, compilation is better as the binary file can run really fast so it is much better in production.
in JS much more checks are there on run time, TYPESCRIPT resolve this

2. Dynamically Typed
we can change the data types of the variables in JS 

3. Single Threaded
JS processes one task at a time , it can use one CPU of the machine 

Rust, Go these are multi threaded 

4. Garbage Collection 

there are three ways in which a language manages the memory 
a. garbage  collector - e.g. java , JS
b. manual
c. rust way
