TAILWIND 

tailwind is used as it is not opioniated

react and react dom are the default dependencies in a react project

to add the tailwind

1. npm install tailwindcss @tailwindcss/vite

2. go to the tailwindconfig.js and add this 

content: ["./index.html", "./src/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}"],

these files will be compiled to css
tailwind finally creates a css file

3, add this code in index.css 

@import "tailwindcss";

@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;



01-react -> flex
02-react -> grids
03-react -> responsivness
responsiveness in tailwind is mobile first

return <div className="sm:bg-blue-300 bg-red-300">hi there</div>;
unpefixed utilities take effect by default but the prefixed utilities appear ont he breakpoint and above

tailwind comes with some default colors but we can overwrite them
