TAILWIND 

tailwind is used as it is not opioniated

react and react dom are the default dependencies in a react project

to add the tailwind
npm install tailwindcss @tailwindcss/vite

go to the tailwindconfig.js and add this 
content: ["./index.html", "./src/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}"],

tailwind finally creates a css file

these files will be compiled to css

01-react -> flex
02-react -> grids
03-react -> responsivness
responsiveness in tailwind is mobile first

return <div className="sm:bg-blue-300 bg-red-300">hi there</div>;
unpefixed utilities take effect by default but the prefixed utilities appear ont he breakpoint and above

tailwind comes with some default colors but we can overwrite them
