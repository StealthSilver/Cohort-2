CLIENT SIDE RENDERING 

it is a modern technique where the rendering of the web page is done in the browser by js
it is sutomatically done by react 

browser ---> user ---> CDN 
white page <--- index.html <--- CDN 

script ---> CDN 
JS runs the dev logic < --- CDN 
page renders

after building a js file and html file is generated by the react building

client side rendering is not SEO optimised, user sees a flash before the reload, also there is the waterfall problem
the browser is waterfalling the requests one aftere the other.

SERVER SIDE RENDERING 

when the rendering process happens on the server, this is provided by next js

browser ---> url ---> next server ---> db 
page renders with the details <--- html is populated <--- next server 
the server lifted the components from the server. it is seo optimised, gets rid of hte waterfalling problem as only one request is sent
